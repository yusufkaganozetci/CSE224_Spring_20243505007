This repository is created for CSE-224 Spring 2025 project. Since OpenLane itself is also a Github repository, I created this repository inside my local /OpenLane/designs. 

Folder Structure:

OpenLane

-> designs (This repository is placed inside this folder!)

->-> example_design

->->-> src

->->->-> example_design.v

->->->-> example_design.sdc
